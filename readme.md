Bulk registration MOD for phpBB
===============================

This MOD provides a module in the ACP to easily register users in bulk using data from a CSV file. You can set usernames, emails, custom profile fields, group memberships, forum subscriptions and more, all straight from the CSV file. Passwords are automatically generated and sent to each user.
